TO DO:
- "current market price" which uses steam market API to grab current price -> alter item name to not include special characters and commas/periods etc
- might need to create rotating proxy to bypass API limit for current market price
- NLP for current market sentiment on all csgo terms (create index of market sentiment using web scrapers on reddit, hltv, etc)
